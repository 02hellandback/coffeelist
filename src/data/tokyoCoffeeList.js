  title: "Tokyo Coffee",
  shortDescription:
    "A curated mix of specialty coffee shops and classic kissaten-style cafés across Tokyo.",
  longDescription: `
This list splits Tokyo coffee into two main types of establishments:

- Specialty: modern, third-wave style shops focused on beans, brewing, and clean design.
- Kissa / Classic / Vibes: old-school coffee houses and cozy spots with character and atmosphere.

Use it as a loose guide, not a strict route. Pick an area you’re in, choose a mood, and drop into a couple of places.
